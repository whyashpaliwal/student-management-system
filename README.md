Right click on the form and select View as Text from the pop-up menu to view this file. Manual alterations to this file may prevent the IDE from being able to load the form.

".dof" : Delphi Project Options File. Text file containing project options (such as compiler and linker settings, version info, search path and output directories).

".cfg" : Project ConfigurationFile. The Delphi IDE automatically creates this file from the settings in the .DOF file.
".dcu" : Delphi Compiled Unit File.
